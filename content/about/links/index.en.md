## HDR

The HDR images were processed with [`libultrahdr`](https://github.com/google/libultrahdr). Knowledge and tools are based on the preliminary work of [Greg Benz](https://gregbenzphotography.com/hdr/) and others. The HDR converter has been [inspired](https://github.com/albertz/playground/blob/master/ultrahdr.py) by the work of [Albert Zeyer](http://www.az2000.de/).

## Typography

The variable font [Handjet](https://rosettatype.com/Handjet) from [Rosetta Type](https://rosettatype.com/) is used for titles and headings. This font allows the manipulation of different axes via CSS. This makes different appearances easily configurable via a stylesheet.

The [Variable Fonts](https://v-fonts.com/) page from [HEX Projects](https://hex.xyz/) offers an overview and provides the possibility setting the various parameters directly in the browser.

## Art

During the research and realisation, I came across the volume "Fotografien der Fotografie. Generative Systeme 1960 bis 2020" by [Gottfried Jäger](https://www.lr-develop.de/gottfried-jaeger/), published in 2023 by S. Wienand Verlag, Cologne (ISBN 978-3-86832-751-9), fell into my hands. As the structures shown here have a certain similarity to Jäger's pinhole structures, his work is mentioned here.
