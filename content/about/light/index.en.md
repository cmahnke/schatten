This page is dedicated to a relatively new phenomenon: "digital" shadows.

I refer to the shadows cast by modern street lamps as "digital" shadows. Many small light sources arranged in a grid (so called LED arrays or matrix LEDs) cast shadows which, when overlapping, produce patterns which look like pixels.

The "new" or "digital" shadows are a relatively new phenomenon: even though the light bulb was allegedly "banned" by the EU in 2009, the technological change to LEDs for street lamps took a little longer. Even today the process has not been completed everywhere.

The [next page](#phenomenon) illustrates how the shadows are created.
