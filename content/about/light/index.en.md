This page is dedicated to a relatively new phenomenon: "digital" shadows.

I refer to the shadows cast by modern street lamps as "digital" shadows. Many small light sources arranged in a grid (so called LED arrays or matrix LEDs) cast shadows which, when overlapping, produce patterns which look like pixels.

# Night
For millions of years the night was dark, and insects and other nocturnal animals have adapted to this. They orientated themselves towards the moon or other weak natural light sources at night. These light sources, such as the moon and the stars, influence not only the day-night cycles but also reproduction...

# Light
However, the number of nocturnal insects in Europe is continuously decreasing. And the illumination of the night is progressing: with the invention of the light bulb around 140 years ago, the cost of lighting fell massively, while the number of light sources per inhabitant rose (and continues to rise) sharply in return. Even though problems such as ['light pollution'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_pollution), the negative impact on nocturnal insects and the ‘disappearance’ of the stars have long been recognised and an effect on melatonin production, for example, is suspected, in recent years the uncanny alliance of an increased need for security and increased energy efficiency has tended to lead to an increase in night-time light sources...

# Shadow
The "new" or "digital" shadows are a relatively new phenomenon: even though the light bulb was allegedly "banned" by the EU in 2009, the technological change to LEDs for street lamps took a little longer. Even today the process has not been completed everywhere.

The [next page](#phenomenon) illustrates how the shadows are created.
