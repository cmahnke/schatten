# Idea

The idea for the project is already a few years old, originally conceived as a short series for [YAAPB](https://yaapb.projektemacher.org/), it lay dormant for over half a decade. Even though it wasn't realised in that time, I used the time to get a little more involved with street and city lighting at night.

At the beginning of this year (2024), the time had come: in late winter, the first analogue and digital test shots were taken, the latter to serve as placeholders for the website. In the area of analogue photography, the low amount of light for night shots posed a particular challenge. Which camera and which film was used in each case is noted in the respective contributions.

The website offered the opportunity to familiarise oneself with some of the features of modern browsers, in particular the HDR support.

In addition to the documentation and illustration, it is also important to me to show the broader context and the resulting problems: So what is described with ["light pollution"](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lichtverschmutzung). Basically, the site is also intended to stimulate discussion about the need to illuminate the night.

# High dynamic range

As I am particularly interested in the dialog between the analogue and digital worlds, the images were enriched with an additional contrast layer. As a result, some of the images appear 'luminous' in an HDR-capable browser.
This also serves as an illustration to train the viewer's eye for subjective perception.
